# Suspected source-file groupings (ledger)

Lightweight, hand-maintained priors about which functions belonged to the
same original translation unit. NOT authoritative — `configs/splat.yaml` is
the source of truth for actual splits; this file records *suspected*
groupings with the evidence that justifies them.

Why it matters: same-file membership has compiler-visible consequences —
shared TU-level quirks (e.g. a file-scope register variable reserving a
register for everything after its declaration point), shared idiom priors,
shared static/global data clusters, and declaration-order effects. Knowing
the group changed func_8001E9F8 from a multi-session mystery into a
15-minute solve.

Rules:
- Every entry cites its evidence class (shared gp-rel cluster, call graph,
  TU quirk, address adjacency, shared idiom). No evidence, no entry.
- Update in the same session that produces new grouping evidence (new
  shared global, new caller, confirmed/denied member). Correct entries that
  turn out wrong; do not let them linger.
- Confidence: high = multiple independent fingerprints; medium = one strong
  fingerprint; low = adjacency/negative evidence only.
- Match status notation: (m) matched in src/, (s) stub, (?) membership
  uncertain.

Scope: membership and evidence only. A member's role gets one line — what it
appears to do and how it relates to its neighbours. Matching technique,
debugging advice, and per-function solve detail belong in
`notes/research/` or `notes/retros/`; an active decompilation effort belongs
in its campaign note. Keep this file readable as a map.

## "collision.c" — 0x8001E334–0x8001EFA4 (confidence: high)

Floor/surface collision subsystem: walkmesh quads split into triangle
tests against a query point, hit recorded in globals.

Fingerprints:
- shared gp-rel cluster D_8005E4F0–D_8005E528 (query point, tolerances,
  cross products, hit flag, hit-triangle vertex pointers — semantic
  hypotheses annotated in include/globals_override.h);
- TU-wide quirk: a file-scope `register s32 x asm("$2")` declared between
  func_8001E878 and func_8001E9F8 — functions before it use $v0 as
  scratch, functions after have it reserved (byte-verified in both);
- internal call graph: E4C0 (driver) → E78C/EAE4/E38C/E7DC;
  EAE4 (poly iterator) → E878 ×4 + E9F8 ×4; E9F8 → E878 ×2;
  E38C → func_80038674 (external consumer).

Members (address order):
- SetVal8005E51C 0x8001E334 (m) — tolerance setter
- func_8001E340 (s)(?) — tiny; touches no cluster globals
- func_8001E38C (s) — post-hit consumer, guards on D_8005E528
- func_8001E4C0 (s) — driver: clears flags, installs query pointer
- func_8001E6FC (s) — small; query pointer + D_8005E524
- func_8001E78C (m) — 2D proximity test; owns D_8005E520 (tolerance)
- func_8001E7DC (m) — 3D form of E78C, same D_8005E520 tolerance
- func_8001E878 (m) — point-in-triangle; CAPTURE_PREV_RET policy exception
- func_8001E9F8 (m) — point-in-quad; file-scope $2 register variable
- func_8001EAE4 (s) — polygon-list iterator, flag masks D_8005E4FC
- func_8001EFA4 (s)(?) — touches no cluster globals; possible file tail

## unknown group A — 0x8001E04C–0x8001E26C (confidence: low)

Address-adjacent block preceding collision.c; none of its functions touch
the collision cluster (checked 2026-07-31), so the file boundary likely
falls between func_8001E26C and SetVal8005E51C. No positive grouping
evidence yet — recorded to mark the boundary question.
Members: func_8001E04C (s), func_8001E088 (s), func_8001E0B8 (s),
func_8001E158 (m), func_8001E160 (s), func_8001E26C (s).

## unknown group B — around 0x80022738–0x80022F1C (confidence: low)

Game-state/flags readers over the D_8006C838 struct array.

Fingerprints:
- both members walk D_8006C838 through a `char *base = (char *)&D_8006C838`
  pointer variable (byte-verified idiom in both);
- func_80022738's target reaches D_8005E5CC and D_8005E5B4 gp-relatively,
  so the original TU declares both (ASPSX gp-rel rule — see the
  func_80016C08 entry);
- SetVal8005E2BC and SetVal8005E334 are void-returning: func_80022738
  matches only with void prototypes (an implicit-int/s32 declaration adds a
  dead `$v0` call def that blocks the target's `$v0` scratch allocation).

Members (address order):
- func_80022738 (m) — flag-slot state check/advance (byte at +0xCC, 4 -> 5)
- func_80022F1C (m) — u16 threshold bucketing at a large computed offset

The GetVal8005E5B4/GetVal8005E5B8 accessors are natural same-TU candidates
via the gp-rel declarations; membership unverified.

## "grid-cursor.c" — around 0x80023DBC–0x800243D0 (confidence: low)

D-pad cursor movement on a 14-column grid (menu/keyboard screen?).
Fingerprints: func_800241EC (m) directly calls func_800243D0 (s) as its
default vertical-move handler (call graph + address adjacency, 0x800243D0
begins just past 0x800241EC's end); shared absolute-addressed parallel
table cluster D_80055994/D_800559BC (bounds byte-table bases) and
D_800559C4 (handler function pointers). func_80023DBC (s)(?) is the sole
caller. Handlers stored in D_800559C4 are unidentified — resolving them
would extend the group.
Members: func_80023DBC (s)(?), func_800241EC (m), func_800243D0 (s).

## pad initialization and state — 0x80013B04–0x80014388 (confidence: medium)

Pad setup, per-port state polling, and decoded controller input.
Fingerprints: func_80014064 initializes D_8005E9C8 through PadInitDirect;
adjacent func_8001413C reads the same buffer and calls func_80014388;
func_800140C8 is between them, calls PadGetState/PadSetActAlign, and its sole
caller func_80013B04 also calls adjacent func_80013F90 while processing pad
state.
Members: func_80013B04 (s) — pad-state driver; func_80013F90 (m) — clears a
per-port state object; func_80014064 (m) — initializes pad buffers and starts
communication; func_800140C8 (m) — polls one port and aligns its actuators;
func_8001413C (s) — decodes one D_8005E9C8 port record; func_80014388 (s) —
input decoder called by func_8001413C.

## GPU primitive packet initializers — 0x8001526C–0x80015594 (confidence: high)

Adjacent helpers that initialize one PSY-Q primitive, select its opaque or
semitransparent code through the same conditional diamond, link it with
`addPrim`, and return the next packet slot. The matched func_800154CC and
func_80015594 targets share the same entry, color-extraction, branch, and tag
linking fingerprints; primitive-specific field counts explain their middle
sections.

Members (address order):
- func_8001526C (m) — TILE_1 primitive initializer, code 0x68
- func_8001530C (s) — small primitive initializer, code 0x40
- func_800153BC (m) — POLY_G4 initializer, code 0x38/0x3A
- func_800154CC (m) — POLY_F4 initializer, code 0x28/0x2A
- func_80015594 (m) — TILE initializer, code 0x60/0x62

## sprite data, animation, and renderers — 0x80015704–0x80016C08

Family confidence: high. Exact TU boundary confidence: medium. The current
best split is after func_800161AC: source-data initialization, animation
helpers, dispatchers, and renderer wrappers at 0x80015704–0x800161AC, then
the two renderers and entry driver at 0x80016280–0x80016C08. This supersedes
the earlier assumption that the whole family was one TU. See
`notes/sprite-renderer-family-campaign.md` for per-function detail.

Fingerprints:
- internal call graph: func_80015E3C and func_80015EE8 call func_80016280;
  func_80015E78, func_80015F80, func_80016054, func_800160C8, and
  func_800161AC call func_800165D8;
- both renderers decode the same source-data layout (`field_1C`, `field_20`,
  `field_24`, `field_28`, and `field_2C`), use the same 0xFFFE header guard,
  and walk the same 12-byte entry records;
- address adjacency and wrapper forwarding preserve the same byte/halfword
  argument roles and bracket both renderers with no unrelated function;
- func_80015704 initializes the same source-data/animation object consumed
  by the family: header-relative pointers at `field_1C`, `field_20`,
  `field_24`, `field_28`, and `field_2C`; adjacent func_800158E4 advances
  animation through `field_28`/`field_2C`, func_80015AAC maps two low-byte
  indices through `field_28`/`field_2C` and then `field_20`/`field_24` with
  the family's 0xFFFE guard, and the 0x80015BF0–0x80015D6C dispatchers call
  func_800158E4 before selecting renderer wrappers.
- func_80016054 and func_80015704 both expand the exact split-statement
  CAPTURE_RA macro (`addu $8,<addr>,$0`; `sw $31,0($8)`). This proves a
  shared studio header and strengthens their pre-render-module grouping,
  but a shared header alone is not same-TU proof — see
  `notes/research/caller-capture-debug-hook.md`.
- TU-boundary flag evidence: `-mno-split-addresses` is carried independently
  by func_800165D8 and func_80016C08. In contrast, applying it to the exact
  sources for func_80015704 and func_80016054 regresses them from 68/68 to
  16/68 and from 29/29 to 23/29. Since flags are per TU, those functions
  cannot share the renderer/driver TU. func_80016280 is byte-inert under the
  flag because it has no symbolic references; its adjacency and semantic
  twin relationship with func_800165D8 place the most likely boundary
  between func_800161AC and func_80016280.

Members (address order):
- func_80015704 (m) — validates a table header and initializes the shared
  source-data/animation object; calls adjacent func_80015880
- func_80015814–func_800158D8 (mixed) — flag/state setters and source-data
  accessors over the object initialized by func_80015704
- func_800158E4 (m) — animation-state/frame-timing update using the source
  object's `field_28` and `field_2C` tables
- func_80015A18–func_80015A94 (mixed) — source-data accessors
- func_80015AAC (m) — maps two low-byte indices through the source object's
  `field_28`/`field_2C` tables, applies the 0xFFFE guard, then resolves the
  result through `field_20`/`field_24`; sole caller is func_80017284
- func_80015B24–func_80015DD4 (mixed) — entry lookup and dispatchers;
  func_80015BF0–func_80015D6C bridge func_800158E4 to the wrappers below
- func_80015E3C (m) — thin func_80016280 wrapper (8 params: 4 register + 4 stack)
- func_80015E78 (m) — thin func_800165D8 wrapper
- func_80015EE8 (m) — packet setup/teardown around func_80016280
- func_80015F80 (m) — packet setup/teardown around func_800165D8
- func_80016054 (m) — func_800165D8 wrapper with CAPTURE_RA caller-log hook
  (include/debughook.h)
- func_800160C8 (m) — packet setup/teardown around func_800165D8 (13 params)
- func_800161AC (m) — packet setup/teardown around func_800165D8
- func_80016280 (m)(?) — SPRT/DR_MODE renderer, active C/asm hybrid; likely
  first member of the `-mno-split-addresses` renderer/driver TU, but its lack
  of symbolic references makes the flag byte-inert
  (see research/func_80016280-web-parity-and-register-recurrence.md)
- func_800165D8 (m) — larger direct-primitive renderer; shares the absolute
  (non-gp-relative) D_8005E3C0 access with func_80016C08, which is the real
  TU-level fact for this group: neither file owns that symbol. Both were
  previously matched with a -mno-split-addresses per-file flag; that flag was
  withdrawn 2026-08-08 and both match under baseline flags
  (`notes/adr-0001-symbol-addressing-at-the-assembler-boundary.md`)
- func_80016B7C (m) — sprite data size calculator; calls func_80015B24 (entry
  search/bcmp) + func_8001782C (tile load/LoadImage); sole caller is
  func_80016C08
- func_80016C08 (m) — sprite entry loop driver; calls func_80016B7C twice.
  Declares D_8005E438: the target reaches it gp-relatively, and ASPSX only
  emits gp-relative for symbols the file itself declares. That rule makes any
  gp-relative access in the original a TU-membership signal — see
  `notes/research/func_80016C08-tu-owned-globals-and-gp-relative-addressing.md`

## Boot / main-loop TU (0x80011370 – 0x800128DC)

Confidence: **high** — shared gp-relative cluster, the strongest signal this
ledger recognises.

Evidence: these functions reach the 0x8005E27C–0x8005E3C0 small-data cluster
GP-relatively, and every other function in the binary reaches the same symbols
absolutely. Under the ASPSX rule recorded for func_80016C08 (gp-relative only
for symbols the file itself declares), that makes them one translation unit —
the one that owns the cluster. The six symbols observed both ways are
D_8005E3A4, D_8005E3A8, D_8005E3AC, D_8005E3B0, D_8005E3B4 and D_8005E3C0;
40+ functions outside this range use the absolute form.

- func_80011370 (m) — game entry / main loop: init sequence then an infinite
  loop with a 0x15-entry switch on D_8005E39C (scene id). Owns D_8005E3A8 and
  D_8005E3AC outright (sole gp-relative accessor). Byte-verified 2026-08-08
- func_80011C24 (s) — called at the bottom of the main loop every iteration
- func_80011DB0 (s), func_80011F5C (s), func_80011FD8 (s) — share D_8005E3C0
  and D_8005E3B4
- func_8001202C (s), func_80012098 (s), func_8001231C (s), func_80012598 (s) —
  share D_8005E3B0
- func_800120C8 (s) — touches the widest set of the cluster; called from
  func_80011370's init
- func_800121D4 (s), func_800128DC (s) — share D_8005E3C0; func_800128DC is
  called from the main loop and from several switch cases

Practical consequence for anyone matching a member: a gp-relative access in
the target is a membership signal, and a member must *declare* the symbols it
reaches that way. Non-members must not. See
`plans/toolchain-native-small-data-addressing.md` for how that is expressed in
source.

Technique and per-function detail for this group live in
`notes/sprite-renderer-family-campaign.md`; the frame-size/arity diagnostic
these wrappers illustrate is in
`notes/research/frame-size-arity-diagnostic.md`.

## VAB transfer setup/state — around 0x80020E58–0x800217B0 (confidence: medium)

Sound-bank transfer setup and progress state.
Fingerprints: func_80020E58 directly calls func_800214FC, func_800215EC,
func_80021604, and func_80021668; func_80020E58, func_800214FC, and
func_80021604 share the absolute D_80049370 table; func_800215EC,
func_80021604, and func_80021668 share the D_8006C7B8 transfer-state object.
Members: func_80020E58 (s) — transfer setup/dispatcher; func_800214FC (s) —
selects a D_80049370 span and starts an operation; func_800215EC (m) — writes
the first three transfer-state words; func_80021604 (m) — initializes transfer
progress from adjacent D_80049370 entries; func_80021668 (s) — advances the
partial VAB transfer.

## candidates to investigate

- func_80021E60's pool-carving table neighborhood (19-entry pointer/count
  parallel arrays over 0x18-byte elements) — likely has sibling functions
  reading the same table; no membership evidence collected yet.
